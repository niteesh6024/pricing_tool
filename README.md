    docker run -d \
        --name pricing_postgres \
        -e POSTGRES_DB=pricing_tool \
        -e POSTGRES_USER=pricing_user \
        -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=pricing_tool \
        -p 5432:5432 \
        postgres
    ```

3. **Apply migrations:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Run the backend server:**
   ```sh
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

### Frontend Setup

## Configuration

- **Email verification:**  
  After creating an account, you will receive an email to activate your account. By default, email sending is disabled for simplicityâ€”the verification URL will be logged in the backend console.  
  To verify your account, copy the URL from the console and open it in your browser or send a GET request to it.

  To enable real email sending, update these settings in `settings.py`:
  ```python
  EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
  EMAIL_HOST_USER = "your_email@example.com"
  EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'your_password'

- **Enable/Disable Summarizer:**  
  In `pricing_tool_backend/settings.py`, set:
  ```python
  ENABLE_SUMMARIZER = True  # or False
  ```
- **JWT Token Lifetime:**  
  Adjust in `settings.py` under `SIMPLE_JWT`.

## Testing

1. **Create an admin account:**  
   - Register as an admin user.
   - Check the backend logs for the email verification link and use it to activate your account.
   - Log in as admin and add some product categories.

2. **Create a seller account:**  
   - Register as a seller user.
   - Verify the account using the link from the backend logs.
   - Log in as seller and add some products under the categories created by the admin.

3. **Test demand forecasting and summarization:**  
   - Use the toggle button to enable demand forecasting.
   - Select one or more products to view demand forecast charts and AI-generated summaries.

4. **Test price optimization:**  
   - Navigate to the "Price Optimization" tab to view optimized price suggestions for your products.

## Assignment Outcomes

- Implement secure, role-based authentication and authorization.
- Allow sellers/admins to manage products and categories.
- Provide demand forecasting and price optimization features.
- Integrate an AI summarizer for product analytics.
- Ensure a responsive, user-friendly frontend with clear navigation and data visualization.
- Use best practices for API design, permissions, and frontend-backend integration.

## Notes

- The summarizer feature uses a transformer model and may require significant memory; it can be toggled in settings.
